- anti_greedy_test.ipynb
    Shows how close we can get to beating the greedy player

- greedyk_comp
    No point in rolling more
    But there is interest in increasing the amount of rounds

- sesqa_greedy_test
    Shows how how this player can out perform the greedy player
    (Only in lower thresholds)

-test_prob_player
    Shows the "low" effectiveness of the probabilistic player



TO-DO:
test the k-roll effectiveness
